    In React Native, native components are platform-backed components that are implemented using the same views as Android and iOS. These components are designed to look, feel, and perform like other apps on the platform.

    Core components, on the other hand, are a set of essential native components that are provided by React Native out-of-the-box. These core components are ready-to-use and can be used to start building your app right away.

    In summary, native components refer to all platform-backed components in React Native, while core components refer specifically to the essential, ready-to-use components provided by React Native.
